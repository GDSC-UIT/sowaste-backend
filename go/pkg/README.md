# **/pkg**

In `/internal` we store code that we were unable to import into other applications, whereas in `/pkg` we store libraries used in third-party applications. This makes it possible to import them into a different project, and avoid the need to duplicate code from project to project. Generally speaking, it is our custom or shared libraries that are stored here.

You donâ€™t have to use this directory if the project is very small and it makes no practical sense to add a new nesting level.
