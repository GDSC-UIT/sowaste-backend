Broken glass that is not contaminated with chemicals, infectious agents, or other hazardous materials can be collected in either approved broken glass boxes or 5-gallon buckets with lids.

Always pick up broken glass using a brush and dustpan, tongs or forceps and place into a container specifically designated for broken glass disposal, to minimize the risk for injury. Broken glass should never be handled directly and should never be placed into the regular trash.

## How to dispose of or recycle Broken Glass

Recycle **ONLY** broken bottles and jars.

Broken porcelain, ceramics, Pyrex, glassware, window glass, picture frame glass, and mirror glass go in the garbage cart.  Broken light bulbs should be put in puncture-proof containers and taken to the HHW drop-off facility (Household Hazardous Waste).

Place small broken glass or ceramic items in a small plastic bag or wrap them in newspaper. Put large pieces of broken glass or ceramics inside two layers of plastic bags, and then label the bags as broken glass or ceramics. Large pieces that are in tact should be taken to the landfill.

### Do Not Recycle Broken Drink Glasses & Pyrex

Broken stemware, other drink glasses, porcelain, and Pyrex cannot be recycled. These types of glass are made from mixed materials that will contaminate the glass recycling process for bottles and jars.
